# capacity-plan-calculator
## Description

Capacity Plan Calculator is a tool designed to help you plan the capacity of your solution 
architecture effectively. 

## Inputs

- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: An integer representing the number of active users per day.
- **Requests per User**: An integer representing the number of requests each user makes.
- **Size per Request**: An integer representing the size of each request.
- **Reads vs Writes**: A ratio indicating the proportion of reads to writes (e.g., 9:1).

## Outputs

- **Requests Per Second (RPS)**: The number of requests processed per second.
- **Bandwidth**: The amount of bandwidth required to handle the traffic.
- **Storage**: The storage capacity needed for the data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mairaafreitas/capacity-plan-calculator.git
```
2. Run the application:
```shell
python app.py
```
3. Enter the required inputs when prompted.

## Example
```shell
$  python app.py
Welcome to the Capacity Plan Calculator

Let's plan together? We are going to calculate:
- Requests Per Second (RPS)
- Read/Write Requests Per Second (RPS)
- Bandwith required for the requests
- Storage

Enter the Daily Active Users (DAU): 1000000         
Enter the total Requests per user: 10
Enter the Reads vs Writes proportion (e.g: 9:1): 9:1
Request size (kb): 10
Replication factor: 3

--------------------Results--------------------
======Requests======
Requests Per Second (RPS) = Daily Active Users * Requests Per User / Seconds Per Day
The Requests Per Day is: 10000000 requests
The Requests Per Second (RPS) is: 115.74rps
Read Requests Per Second is: 104.17rps
Write Requests Per Second is: 11.57rps

======Bandwith======
Bandwith = Requests per second * Average request size
The Bandwith required for the requests is: 1157.4kbs
The Bandwith required for the requests is: 1.1574mbs

======Storage======
Storage Per Second = Writes per second * Average request size * Replication factor
Storage required for a second: 347.1kbs
Storage required for a second: 0.3471mbs
Storage required for a day: 10.9461mbs
Storage required for a day: 29.9894gb
